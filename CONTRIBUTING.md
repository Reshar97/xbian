# Reporting an issue
**Before reporting a bug, please make sure you're using the latest version of XBian with all updates installed, or at least verify that the problem is still reproducible with the latest version. Your bug might be already fixed.**

We can't provide support for XBMC/Kodi add-ons made by third parties - you should get in contact with the add-on author(s) in that case.

Open a new issue and try to answer the following questions:
- what did you do?
- what did you expect to happen?
- what happened instead?

If you're having an issue with XBMC/Kodi, please provide a debug enabled log file ([instructions](http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy)).

Make sure to specify which platform, _and the specific model_, you're experiencing the problem on:
- Raspberry Pi
- CuBox-i and/or HummingBoard

## Don't ignore us
Developers might ask further questions regarding the issue you're experiencing, or may want you to test a specific version of a package which may fix your problem.

Please remember that this an open source project and people are doing their best **in their free time**.

Also, there's no point in reporting a bug if you don't actually care to get it fixed.
